    <blockquote style="text-align: center;"><em>I think as a company, if you can get those two things right — having a clear direction on what you are trying to do <br />
        and bringing in great people who can execute on the stuff — then you can do pretty well. </em><br />

    <section id="about-main">
    <p>When I was seven years old, I stood in the corner of my family living room, bouncing on my heels as 
        my dad and the hired electrician hooked up our new computer... with internet. Within an hour, I was on
        Disneychannel.com, taking Lizzie McGuire themed personality quizzes. That was only the beginning. 
    </p>
    <p>To say I'm a child of the internet would be an understatement. I quickly caught on to social media platforms,
        video browsing communities, and the early forums of the first memes. My teenage years were carefully divided between 
        watching "Glee" and then talking about it on Tumblr.
    </p>
    <p>By the time college rolled around, I had added enough custom CSS to my personal accounts to realize I had a knack
        for web design! Thus, I graduated with a computer science minor from the University of Vermont in 2016. After four 
        years in the professional world, sharpening my web development skills, I found myself, much like the rest of the world,
        contemplating my life choices as quarantine enshrouded our lives with uncertainty. 
    </p>
    <p>As lockdowns waned and wavered, I found a new purpose: become the programming master I always wanted to be. 
        With my experience in HTML and CSS in one hand, and an internet filled with resources, I began a new journey.
    </p>
    <p>Through practice, practice, and more practice (and the more than occasional iced coffee), I've made 
        some great strides and learned a lot. This website is a manifestation of what I've learned so far. 
    </p>
    <p>Welcome, thank you, and enjoy.</p>
